## Parallel PageRank Algorithm

### **Objective**:
#### Implement a parallel PageRank algorithm using OpenMP.

### **Description**:
#### PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages. The goal is to parallelize the PageRank algorithm to handle large web graphs efficiently.

### **Steps**:
- Implement the PageRank algorithm in serial.
- Identify the independent computations in the PageRank algorithm.
- Use OpenMP to parallelize these computations.
- Handle convergence and synchronization issues to ensure correctness.
- Test the parallel PageRank algorithm with large web graphs and compare its performance with the serial version.
### **Key Learning Outcomes**:
- Understanding and implementing the PageRank algorithm.
- Parallelize graph algorithms with iterative updates.
- Managing convergence and synchronization in parallel computations.
